/**
 * Describe the long-named options requested by the application. The LONG_OPTIONS argument to getopt_long or getopt_long_only is a vector
 * of `struct option' terminated by an element containing a name which is zero. The field `has_arg' is:
 *
 * no_argument       (or 0) if the option does not take an argument,
 * required_argument (or 1) if the option requires an argument,
 * optional_argument (or 2) if the option takes an optional argument.
 *
 * If the field `flag' is not NULL, it points to a variable that is set to the value given in the field `val' when the option is found, but
 * left unchanged if the option is not found. To have a long-named option do something other than set an `int' to a compiled-in constant,
 * such as set a value from `optarg', set the option's `flag' field to zero and its `val' field to a nonzero value (the equivalent single-letter
 * option character, if there is one). For long options that have a zero `flag' field, `getopt' returns the contents of the `val' field

/**

 * Return the option character from OPTS just read.  Return -1 when there are no more options.  For unrecognized options, or options missing
 * arguments, `optopt' is set to the option letter, and '?' is returned. The OPTS string is a list of characters which are recognized option
 * letters, optionally followed by colons, specifying that that letter takes an argument, to be placed in `optarg'. If a letter in OPTS is
 * followed by two colons, its argument is optional.  This behavior is specific to the GNU `getopt'. The argument `--' causes premature termination
 * of argument scanning, explicitly telling `getopt' that there are no more options. If OPTS begins with `--', then non-option arguments are treated
 * as arguments to the option '\0'. This behavior is specific to the GNU `getopt'
