json|Test 1 - JSON serialization|This test exercises the framework fundamentals including keep-alive support, request routing, request header parsing, object instantiation, JSON serialization, response header generation, and request count throughput
db|Test 2 - Single database query|This test exercises the framework's object-relational mapper (ORM), random number generator, database driver, and database connection pool
query|Test 3 - Multiple database queries|This test is a variation of Test #2 and also uses the World table. Multiple rows are fetched to more dramatically punish the database driver and connection pool. At the highest queries-per-request tested (20), this test demonstrates all frameworks' convergence toward zero requests-per-second as database activity increases
fortune|Test 4 - Fortunes|This test exercises the ORM, database connectivity, dynamic-size collections, sorting, server-side templates, XSS countermeasures, and character encoding
update|Test 5 - Database updates|This test is a variation of Test #3 that exercises the ORM's persistence of objects and the database driver's performance at running UPDATE statements or similar
plaintext|Test 6 - Plaintext|This test is an exercise of the request-routing fundamentals only, designed to demonstrate the capacity of high-performance platforms in particular. The response payload is still small, meaning good performance is still necessary in order to saturate the gigabit Ethernet of the test environment
